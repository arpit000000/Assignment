    "Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "A database is a structured collection of data that is stored and managed in a computer system. It provides a systematic way of organizing, storing, and retrieving data, making it easier to manage and access large amounts of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) are two different types of databases. SQL databases are relational databases that store data in a structured manner and use SQL for querying data. They have a well-defined schema and are suitable for applications that require complex queries and transactions. Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases, on the other hand, do not use a fixed schema and store data in a non-tabular manner. They are suitable for applications that require high scalability and flexibility. Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, and Couchbase."

    "Q2. What is DDL? Explain why CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE are used with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "DDL (Data Definition Language) is a set of SQL commands used to define and manage the structure of a database. CREATE is used to create a new table, database, or other database objects. For example, the following command creates a new table named \"employees\":\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE TABLE employees (\n",
    "id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "salary DECIMAL(10,2)\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "DROP is used to delete a database, table, or other database objects. For example, the following command drops the \"employees\" table:\n",
    "\n",
    "DROP TABLE employees;\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER is used to modify the structure of a table, such as adding or deleting columns. For example, the following command adds a new column \"age\" to the \"employees\" table:\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER TABLE employees ADD age INT;\n",
    "\n",
    "TRUNCATE is used to remove all data from a table. For example, the following command removes all data from the \"employees\" table:\n",

    "\n",
    "UPDATE employees SET salary = 60000.00 WHERE id = 1;\n",
    "\n",
    "DELETE is used to delete data from a table. For example, the following command deletes the employee with ID 1 from the \"employees\" table:\n",

    "A primary key is a column or set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each record in that table. It must be unique for each record and cannot contain NULL values.

    "A foreign key is a column or set of columns in a table that references the primary key of another table. It establishes a relationship between the two tables, and ensures that data in the referencing table is consistent with the data in the referenced table. For example, in a \"orders\" table, the \"customer_id\" column might be a foreign key that references the \"id\" column in a \"customers\" table. This ensures that every order in the \"orders\" table is associated with a valid customer in the \"customers\" table."
