    "Ans. MongoDB is a popular, open-source, NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. Unlike traditional relational databases that use tables and rows, MongoDB uses collections and documents. This allows for more flexible and scalable data storage and retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, do not use the traditional table-based relational database structure. They are designed to handle a wide variety of data models, including key-value, document, columnar, and graph formats. Non-relational databases are often used for big data and real-time web applications.\n",

    "Scenarios where MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases:\n",
